# Banking-Networking-Project
# üè¶ Bank Network Topology (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a **bank enterprise network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The network was designed with scalability, security, and efficiency in mind ‚Äî implementing VLANs, DHCP, OSPF, SSH, Port Security, and Wireless connectivity for each department.


## üß© Project Overview
The bank network is divided into multiple departments, each assigned a unique VLAN and subnet.  
The design follows a **Hierarchical Network Model** to ensure scalability and structured communication between departments.

### Key Objectives
- Use **OSPF** as the routing protocol to advertise routes between departments.  
- Implement **Wireless Networks** for every department to support wireless users.  
- Each department (except the Server Room) supports around **60 users** (wired + wireless).  
- All **host devices** obtain IPv4 addresses **automatically** through DHCP.  
- Ensure **full inter-department communication** using Inter-VLAN Routing on Layer 3 switches.  
- Deploy **HTTP and E-mail servers** in the Server Room.  
- Assign **dedicated DHCP servers** in the Server Room for dynamic IP allocation.  
- Configure **SSH** on all routers for secure remote login.  
- Apply **basic configurations** on all devices:
  - Hostnames  
  - Console and enable passwords  
  - Banner messages  
  - Disable domain IP lookup  
  - Encrypt all passwords  
- Implement **Port Security** using sticky MAC addressing with violation mode set to *shutdown*.  
- Perform **Subnetting** using base network `192.168.10.0/24` for each VLAN based on user requirements.  
- Test and verify network communication to ensure all departments can connect seamlessly.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Implemented
- Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design  
- Hierarchical Network Architecture  
- Correct Cabling of Networking Devices  
- VLAN Creation and Port Assignments  
- Subnetting and IP Address Planning  
- Inter-VLAN Routing (SVI Configuration on L3 Switches)  
- Dedicated DHCP Server Configuration  
- SSH for Secure Remote Access  
- OSPF Routing Protocol Configuration  
- Port-Security with Sticky MAC and Violation Shutdown  
- Wireless LAN (WLAN) Configuration using Access Points

## üß† Network Planning and Addressing
- **Base Network:** 192.168.10.0/24  
- **Subnetting:** Calculated according to departmental host requirements (approx. 60 users per VLAN).  
- **Each VLAN:** Separate Subnet, VLAN ID, and IP Address Range  
- **Server Room:** Dedicated DHCP, HTTP, and E-mail Servers


## üß™ Testing and Verification
‚úÖ Verify DHCP assignment for all hosts  
‚úÖ Confirm OSPF routing tables between routers  
‚úÖ Test SSH access from remote PCs to routers  
‚úÖ Ping across VLANs to confirm inter-department communication  
‚úÖ Verify Port-Security functionality and sticky MAC behavior  
‚úÖ Confirm wireless and wired device connectivity  


## üñ•Ô∏è Tools Used
